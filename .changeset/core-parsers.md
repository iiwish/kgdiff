`@kgdiff/core` exports everything `@kgdiff/formats` (deprecated) exports, so moving off formats means changing the import path only (`@kgdiff/formats` → `@kgdiff/core`), and the common case needs one package: `import { diff, formatHunk, parseGraph } from '@kgdiff/core'`. Nothing is removed and no type changes.

- `parseGraph`, `detectFormat` and `compactIri`: asynchronous, with the signatures and results of `@kgdiff/formats`'. Like `diff`, they load `@kgdiff/compute` with a dynamic `import()` on the first call, so a bundle that only reads diffs still contains no WebAssembly.
- `FORMAT_EXTENSIONS` and the parsers' types (`FormatId`, `ParseOptions`, `ParseResult`, `ParseWarning`, `ParseWarningCode`, `RdfOptions`, `JsonOptions`, `JsonLdOptions`, `JsonDialect`). `@kgdiff/core` defines them now; `@kgdiff/compute` and `@kgdiff/formats` re-export the same declarations and the same `FORMAT_EXTENSIONS` object.
- `@kgdiff/compute`: its parsers' types and `FORMAT_EXTENSIONS` are re-exported from `@kgdiff/core`, the same declarations as before. `@kgdiff/formats`: its deprecation notes point to `@kgdiff/core`.

The rule: the model packages (`@kgdiff/core`, `@kgdiff/layout`) give asynchronous entries that load the engine on the first call; for the synchronous API, for choosing where the `.wasm` files are loaded from, or for the low-level JSON functions, use `@kgdiff/compute`.
