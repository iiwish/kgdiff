### Minor Changes

- 148fdb1: The viewer embeds as a small looping replay: `<kgdiff-viewer mode="replay" chrome="none" loop>`. `chrome="none"` shows the graph alone, with its hover tooltip and a one-line legend (`legend="auto|full|mini|none"`), no header, change list, step caption, playback bar, zoom buttons or minimap; it fits a 320px strip (the minimum height drops to 120px) and keeps the view fitted. `loop` plays the replay by itself and starts it again after `loop-delay` ms (1200), pausing while the mouse is over the graph unless `pause-on-hover="false"`. A new `kgdiff-replay-end` event fires whenever playback reaches the end. Fitting leaves room for node labels, so the names of the outermost nodes are no longer cut off at the edge of the canvas, and `fit()` takes `{ padding }`; without chrome, a label pushed aside by a neighbour stays inside the canvas or is left out. `@kgdiff/renderer` adds `labelFootprint(frame, theme)`, what a frame covers with its labels at a given zoom, and `setLabelsInside()` / the `labelsInside` option, which keep labels whole inside the canvas.
